## Lecture 1

### Motivation

Health for sure:

- Nourish all parts of your body: gain **strong muscles, sound bones, healthy skin**, to .
- Right amount of energy but also sufficient nutrients
- Prevent disease

Disease: Both genetic and nutritional. Good food prevents the latter causes from happening.

As personal genes varies. Personalized nutrition may allow dietitians to account for variations in a client’s genome to more precisely meet the nutrient needs of the individua

### Human body

Energy come from the **sun** -> plant -> animal -> human

micronutrients = minerals / Vitamin

> Note: minerals / Vitamin have no energy.
> Note: About water: The body constantly loses water, mainly through sweat, breath, and urine, and that water must constantly be replaced

Summary: People eat food (food = energy + nutrients), some of them cannot be generated by human itself.

> Term: Dietary supplements are pills, liquids, or powders that contain purified nutrients or other ingredients

1. General definition of categories of foods  
   | Food Types | Description |
   | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Enriched Foods and Fortified Foods | Foods to which nutrients have been added If the starting material is a whole, basic food such as milk or whole grain, the result may be highly nutritious If the starting material is a concentrated form of sugar or fat, the result is less nutritious |
   | Fast Foods | Fast provided. Nutrients depends on the ingredients |
   | Functional Foods | A marketing term for foods that contain bioactive food components believed to provide health benefits, such as reduced disease risks, beyond the benefits that their nutrients confe |
   | Medical Foods | AFoods specially manufactured for use by people with medical disorders and administered on the advice of a physician |
   | Natural Foods | A term that has no legal definition but is often used to imply wholesomeness |

2. Process or not

Now we start choosing Nutritious food:

### Some mindset towards knowledge of nutrition

1. Nutrition is an active, changing, and growing body of knowledge
2. Nutrition related news/influencers: better not believe because most findings are released before confirmed .
   1. First:
      - Who: what group conducted the study?
      - Purpose: Was the study funded by a company or corporation that stands to profit from the results?
   2. Second: evaluate:
      1. Research methods is valid or not? scientific or not?
      2. How many people are there?
      3. Advertisement or not: Are financial contributors? Are they selling something?
      4. Is it current?
      5. Check sources of information
         > Look for ".gov"/".edu"/".org" as reliable designation
      6. credentials: Registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN)−Accredited college−Registration and licensure•"Nutritionist" has no legal definition or laws regulating. 

### Research

Why One Dietitian is Speaking Up for ‘Ultra-Processed’ Foods

> She swapped her morning eggs for soy chorizo and replaced her thrown-together lunches—sometimes as simple as beans with avocado and hot sauce—with Trader Joe’s ready-to-eat tamales. She snacked on cashew-milk yogurt with jam. For dinner she’d have one of her beloved Costco pupusas, or maybe chicken sausage with veggies and Tater-Tots. She wasn’t subsisting on Fritos, but these were also decidedly not whole foods.

exchange health food with ultra-processed food like chips, soda, bagged bread, frozen food, and cereal -> had more energy and less anxiety and more motivated -> conclude that ultra-processed food is unfairly demonized. 

About **processed** food or not processsed food  -> quite debated like milk 

NOVAt defines an unprocessed food as one that comes directly from a plant or animal, like a fresh-picked apple.
